## Approach Taken

Given this was a group delivered, we treated it like an Agile project:

-   Developed an initial Scope document that included an overall scope, a product feature breakdown and indicative database design.
-   Twice daily stand-up sessions occured to agree on features to be developed next along with supporting each other.
-   Frequent commits and rebasing of the code occured to ensure all project members had the latest build.
